In the basic blink example, this doesn’t matter so much because we aren’t trying to do anything else. But let’s say we wanted to add a second LED of third LED and blink it at a different rate while still continuing to blink the first. Using `time.sleep()` will cause trouble because each LED will have no choice but to wait for the sleep calls that are blinking the other. Their blink rates won’t ever be truly independent. How can we work around this problem? You need a so called multi tasking system. But how do you do that on a single processor unit? "
