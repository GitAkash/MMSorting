    "Servo's are little motors of which the rotor angle can be controlled (between 0 - 180 degrees). A servo is a control system in itself. A potentiometer on the output shaft is used to measure the angle of the output axis. \n",
    "> It is important to understand that there is no feedback of the actual servo position. So you don't know when the Servo \"arrives\" at the required angle.\n",

    "To make life easy we will use a separate Feather board to control the servo's (up to 8). See https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-8-channel-pwm-or-servo-featherwing.

    "You will probably notice that the reach of the servo is less than the 0-180 degrees range. A servo is controlled by a PWM-signal. Default a frequency of 50Hz is used. The width (or better duration) of the on-pulse determines the servo angle. The specified pulse width range of a servo has historically been 1-2 ms, for a 90 degree range of motion. But nearly all modern servos have a 170-180 degree range, and the pulse widths can go well out of the range to achieve this extended motion. The default values here of 750 and 2250 typically give 135 degrees of motion, however this 135 degrees range is controlled with a 0- 180 degrees setting (by default). You can set actuation range to correspond to the actual range of motion you observe with your given min pulse and max pulse values in the object definition, e.g.: `kit.servo[0].set_pulse_width_range(1000, 2000)`"
